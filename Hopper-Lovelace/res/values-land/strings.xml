    <string name="name">Ada Lovelace</string>
    <string name="bio">Ada described her approach as "poetical science" 
        and herself as an "Analyst (&amp; Metaphysician)". As a young adult, 
        her mathematical talents led her to an ongoing working relationship 
        and friendship with fellow British mathematician Charles Babbage, and 
        in particular Babbage\'s work on the Analytical Engine. Between 1842 and 
        1843, she translated an article by Italian military engineer Luigi 
        Menabrea on the engine, which she supplemented with an elaborate set of 
        notes of her own, simply called Notes. These notes contain what many 
        consider to be the first computer programâ€”that is, an algorithm designed 
        to be carried out by a machine. Lovelace\'s notes are important in the 
        early history of computers. She also developed a vision on the capability 
        of computers to go beyond mere calculating or number-crunching while 
        others, including Babbage himself, focused only on those capabilities.
        Ada\'s mind-set of "poetical science" led her to ask basic questions about
         the Analytical Engine (as shown in her notes) examining how individuals 
         and society relate to technology as a collaborative tool.
